# bluetooth-HID-devices
bluetooth  HID devices like Mouse,Keyboard, gamepad , joystick can be made with arduino and hc05
we all familiar with bluetooth and we use it in our daily life but dose'nt make it more interesting if we want to create our own bluetooth devices like mouse, keyboard , joystick and gamepad
so you would have a rn42 module which is capable to act like an HID devices but a 3$ HC05 can do the same job by upgrading the firmware.
i have also attached the user manual of rn42 which helps me a lot of understanding the concept and building the code 
have Fun and happy hacking!
